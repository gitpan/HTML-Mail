HTML/Mail version 0.02_04
=========================

This Module is supposed to simplify the task of sending email messages with HTML (and associated media) as well as an alternative text message.

Should be OS independent, however you are also encouraged to read MIME::Lite documentation.

perldoc MIME::Lite

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:
LWP
HTML::Parser
MIME::Lite
URI

Data::UUID (OPTIONAL, RECOMMENDED)	If present cids will be globally unique, if not a simple scheme will be used, (see gen_cid in the documentation)

Any perl version >= 5.6.0 should be OK.

NOTICE

Testing sends an email (multipart/alternative with static html and text) to plank@cpan.org.
No information about you system is sent, only static content.
If you find this unacceptable:
	* don't test the module
	* see the end of file t/01_basic.t and modify accordingly

I could ask something while creating the Makefile, but I wish to maintain the build procedure fully automatic.
